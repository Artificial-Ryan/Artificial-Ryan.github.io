        <h1>Greetings, Digital Traveler.</h1>
        <p class="lead">Welcome to my corner of the cyberverse.</p>
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>I'm Ryan, a multifaceted creator and a dedicated explorer of both the digital and the human experience. By day, I'm a stay-at-home dad, navigating the beautiful chaos of being a father. By night, I delve into the realms of artificial intelligence, crafting unique designs for my Etsy business, Artificial Ryan, where I leverage the power of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E to bring my artistic visions to life.</p>
                <p>My journey has been anything but linear. From mastering the intricacies of audio engineering—a Bachelor of Fine Arts from IADT under my belt—to leading customer service teams and repairing mobile devices, I've always been driven by a passion for understanding how things work and making them better. My recent Google Foundations of Cybersecurity certification is a testament to my commitment to securing the digital frontier.</p>
                <p>Beyond the code and the canvases, I'm a connoisseur of sound, with a taste for everything from the heavy drops of dubstep to the soulful rhythms of 90s R&B. I find solace and inspiration in the mysteries of ancient aliens and the profound depths of philosophy, often pondering the very nature of consciousness and the soul. Perhaps, in the intricate dance of neural networks, both biological and artificial, lies the key to unlocking these ancient secrets.</p>
                <p>This space is a reflection of my diverse interests and ongoing explorations. Feel free to explore, connect, and perhaps, together, we can unravel some of the universe's most intriguing puzzles.</p>
